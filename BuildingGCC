Make sure the following tools are installed as they are required to build the compiler.

FYI : need gcc and g++ installed
apt-get install gcc
apt-get install g++
apt-get install zlib1g-dev
apt-get install libmpfr-dev libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev flex bison


Binutils only needs a C compiler.  In the past, gcc used to be able 
to compile g++ using a C compiler, but that changed : probably with gcc-4.8.


Grab the gcc / g++ tarballs from

http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/

Expand the tarball in a working directory
Make a gcc-build directory for the gcc build objects

aucuser@debauchery:/dataA/tools/gcc$ pwd
/dataA/tools/gcc
aucuser@debauchery:/dataA/tools/gcc$ ls -l
total 221464
drwxr-xr-x 33 aucuser aucuser      4096 May 22  2014 gcc-4.8.3
-rw-r--r--  1 aucuser aucuser 110834231 Jan 29 17:14 gcc-4.8.3.tar.gz
drwxr-xr-x 34 aucuser aucuser      4096 Oct 30 03:35 gcc-4.9.2
-rw-r--r--  1 aucuser aucuser 115686453 Jan 29 12:44 gcc-4.9.2.tar.gz
drwxr-xr-x 19 aucuser aucuser      4096 Jan 30 10:48 gcc-build
aucuser@debauchery:/dataA/tools/gcc$

cd into build directory (gcc-build) and run as appropriate

../gcc-4.9.2/configure 
--prefix=/opt/gcc/4.9.2
--enable-languages=c,c++ 
--enable-threads=posix 
--program-suffix=4.9 
--without-included-gettext 
--with-system-zlib 
--with-tune=generic 
--disable-checking 
--enable-multiarch
--enable-shared 
--with-gmp=/usr/local/lib 
--with-mpc=/usr/lib 
--with-mpfr=/usr/lib

After the configuration works then run make -j8 to build the compiler

After the compilation is successfull run make install to install the new 
compiler to /opt/gcc/4.9.2 (or in prefix dir as appropriate)

Result of install yields the following message:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /opt/gcc/4.9.2/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
